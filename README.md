Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
In this class, we learned a lot about the use of machine learning and AI's. We were given a template to create a game that an AI could complete. It was our responsibility to modify the code to make the program operate.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Computer scientists use the AI and machine learning to help implement a technology that can automate certain processes. Throughout this course, i learned how to make a secure program that allows users to operate it securely. I am ethically responsible to allow a secure connection for the end user.
